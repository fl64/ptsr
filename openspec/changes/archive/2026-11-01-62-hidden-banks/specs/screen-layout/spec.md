## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Hide the pads
The system SHALL hide and show the pad grid with `Ctrl+O` on the pads (F2), files (F6) and chop (F3) screens, one state for all three. Hidden, the strip takes the place of the grid: the left column from the title line down, with one pad line under it — the bank row of every bank with its fill as above the grid, the open one in brackets, then the selected pad with its name, flashing on a hit; while pads of the open bank are held or flash, its glyphs in the bank row show only those pads, in white, and the fill again after; a narrow window cuts the pad part first; the right column keeps the full height from the title line down, so nothing of it is cut. The assign mode of the chop screen shows the grid while it is open. The state survives a restart.

#### Scenario: Hide the pads
- **WHEN** the owner presses `Ctrl+O` on the pads screen
- **THEN** the grid is gone, the strip is taller by the rows of the grid, and the pad line shows the bank row with bank 1 in brackets and then `pad W kick` for the selected pad W

#### Scenario: Every bank in the pad line
- **WHEN** the pads are hidden, bank 1 is open and bank 3 holds sounds
- **THEN** the pad line shows every bank with its number, bank 3 with its fill and bank 1
  in brackets, each in its color, the same as the bank row above the grid

#### Scenario: A hit lights in the bank row
- **WHEN** the pads are hidden and the owner holds pad Q of bank 3
- **THEN** while pad Q is held or flashes, the glyphs of bank 3 in the bank row show only
  pad Q, in white, no other pad of the bank; after that they show the fill again

#### Scenario: The right column keeps its rows
- **WHEN** the pads are hidden
- **THEN** the right column shows all of it as with the pads shown: the L and R meters and the overload light with the pad panel on F2, the path and the list on F6, the slice line and the side list on F3

#### Scenario: The same on every screen
- **WHEN** the pads are hidden and the owner switches to F6 and F3
- **THEN** both screens draw without the grid, with the same pad line and the same strip height

#### Scenario: The pad line flashes
- **WHEN** the pads are hidden and the owner hits pad Q
- **THEN** the pad line names pad Q and flashes like a hit pad

#### Scenario: The plan shows the grid
- **WHEN** the pads are hidden and the owner opens the assign mode on the chop screen
- **THEN** the grid is drawn with the plan while the assign mode is open, and is hidden again when it closes

#### Scenario: The choice survives a restart
- **WHEN** the owner hides the pads and restarts the program
- **THEN** the pads are hidden; `Ctrl+O` shows them, and a restart keeps them shown
